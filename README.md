‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è **Rock Paper Scissors Game**

---


‚ú® **Overview**
This project is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple and interactive experience where players can challenge the computer in this timeless hand game.
I developed this game as a foundational exercise to solidify my understanding of core JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling, which are essential skills for any web developer.

üí° **What I Learned**

Developing this Rock Paper Scissors game was an excellent opportunity to reinforce fundamental web development concepts. Here are some key takeaways:
DOM Manipulation: Gained practical experience in dynamically updating HTML elements (like scores and messages) using JavaScript.
Event Handling: Mastered attaching event listeners to user interface elements (e.g., button clicks) to trigger game logic.
Conditional Logic & Game Rules: Implemented complex if/else statements to determine win/lose/draw conditions based on player and computer choices.
Random Number Generation: Utilized JavaScript's Math.random() to simulate the computer's unpredictable moves.
Basic Game State Management: Learned to track and update the game's state, including scores and round outcomes.
Function Organization: Practiced structuring code into reusable functions for better maintainability and readability.
